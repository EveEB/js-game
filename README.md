## Overview

### The project

I completed the first game in this course from FreeCodeCamp, led by Ania Kub√≥w. It is a single-player word association game.

The styling is my own design.

<!-- At the end of the course, I added an extra feature of my own so both of the buttons would be disabled after the user had clicked on their first choice. Before this, the user was able to click on the correct answer and score a point back if their first choice had been wrong, and vice versa: there was the danger of losing a point by being able to click on the wrong answer after submitting the correct answer first. -->

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I furthered my knowledge of arrays and loops, and it was a great opportunity to practise using callback functions.

### Continued development

I wish to further develop my skills of arrays, loops and callback functions. I'm aiming to extend this project further through the use of an API to retrieve the information for the questions and tips rather than coding them myself.

### Useful resources

- I used the Emojy extension on VS Code to insert emojis into my game.
